# Advent Of Code
My solutions for Adevent of Code in .Net
Probably not the best choice for speed but it's what I'm most proficient at.
Although I can't compete on the global leaderboards due to the puzzles being released in the middle of my sleep, I still try to solve these as quickly as possible.
I want to preserve the results of this frantic coding, so I limit refactorings to a minimum - like renaming variables and removing excessive printing.
